# Introduction

**Yieldspan** is the first production-grade AI-driven portfolio optimizer that uses **Modern Portfolio Theory** with real-time market data to automatically generate optimal DeFi allocations.

## The Core Innovation - REAL MATHEMATICAL ML

We've built a sophisticated ML engine that implements:

- **Mean-Variance Optimization** with gradient descent algorithms
- **Sharpe Ratio Maximization** for risk-adjusted returns
- **Correlation Matrix Analysis** across 5+ digital assets  
- **Historical Backtesting** with rolling window validation
- **Real-Time Data Integration** from CoinGecko API

## What Makes Us Different

ðŸ§  **AI-First Approach**: Our ML model continuously learns from market data to optimize portfolio allocations

ðŸ”— **Cross-Chain Intelligence**: Unlike single-chain optimizers, we find the best yields across Ethereum, Stellar, and beyond

âš¡ **Real-Time Adaptation**: Algorithms adjust to changing market conditions automatically

ðŸ“± **Simplified UX**: Complex optimization reduced to: *Amount + Time Horizon = Optimal Portfolio*

## For Hackathon Judges

This documentation focuses on our **core differentiator** - the ML portfolio optimization engine. We've intentionally kept the cross-chain bridge implementation simple (mocked) to focus on our unique value proposition.

**The question we solve:** *Given $X for Y time period, what's the mathematically optimal allocation across all available yield opportunities?*
