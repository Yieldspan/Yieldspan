# The Problem

## Current State of DeFi Yield Farming

DeFi offers incredible yield opportunities, but the ecosystem is fragmented and complex:

### 🌐 Multi-Chain Fragmentation
- **Ethereum**: High yields (8-15%) but expensive gas fees
- **Stellar**: Fast/cheap transactions but limited DeFi ecosystem  
- **Polygon, Arbitrum, BSC**: Various yield opportunities with different risk profiles
- **Result**: Users miss opportunities or pay excessive gas moving between chains

### 📊 Information Overload
Current DeFi users must:
- Monitor 50+ protocols across multiple chains
- Analyze APY changes, liquidity risks, smart contract audits
- Manually calculate optimal allocations
- Track impermanent loss and correlation risks

### ⏰ Time-Sensitive Decisions
- Yield rates change hourly based on market conditions
- Optimal strategy for 1 week ≠ optimal strategy for 1 year
- Manual rebalancing is slow and expensive

### 💸 Capital Inefficiency
- Small amounts ($100) get eaten by gas fees
- Large amounts ($10K+) need sophisticated risk management
- Most users pick suboptimal "set and forget" strategies

## The Real Problem

**95% of DeFi users are leaving money on the table** because they lack the tools, time, and expertise to optimize across the entire yield landscape.

### Current "Solutions" Fall Short

❌ **Single-Chain Optimizers** (Yearn, Beefy): Miss cross-chain opportunities  
❌ **Manual Strategies**: Too complex for most users  
❌ **Simple Aggregators**: No intelligence, just basic allocation  
❌ **Traditional Finance**: 0.5% APY in savings accounts

## What Users Actually Want

> *"I have $X and Y time horizon. Give me the best risk-adjusted return possible across all of DeFi, automatically."*

This is an **optimization problem** that requires:
- Real-time data analysis
- Correlation modeling  
- Risk-adjusted return calculations
- Automated execution

**Perfect use case for machine learning.**
